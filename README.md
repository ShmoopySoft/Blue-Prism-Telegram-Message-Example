# Blue Prism Telegram Message Example

A Blue Prism Release Package containing an example Visual Business Object (VBO) and Process to demonstrate sending messages to a Telegram Channel using the Telegram BOT Api through Blue Prism.

## Getting Started

In order to send messages to Telegram from Blue Prism, the following steps must first be completed:

1. Download and install Telegram on your preferred device
2. Create a Telegram public channel
3. Create a Telegram BOT via BotFather
4. Set the bot as administrator in your channel
5. Obtain your channel Chat Id

Obtaining your Chat Id can be tricky, but the following article was useful: https://programmingistheway.wordpress.com/2015/12/03/send-telegram-messages-from-c/

If you completed the steps above, you can now send a message to your channel by issuing an HTTP GET request to the Telegram BOT API at the following URL:

https://api.telegram.org/bot[BOT_API_KEY]/sendMessage?chat_id=[MY_CHAT_ID]&text=[MY_MESSAGE_TEXT]

where:

* BOT_API_KEY is the API Key generated by BotFather when you created your bot
* MY_CHAT_ID is the Chat Id of your channel
* MY_MESSAGE_TEXT is the message you want to send (URL-encoded)

If you are able to send a test message to your Telegram channel, you are ready to continue with the Blue Prism implementation.
